## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are valuable tools for visualizing the structure and relationships within a database before developing the models. By mapping out how different tables interact, ERDs provide a clear overview of the data flow and dependencies, which can streamline the design process. Understanding these connections early on helps identify potential issues, ensuring a more efficient development phase. Additionally, ERDs serve as a useful reference for future updates or modifications to the database, making it easier to maintain and scale the system as the project evolves.
